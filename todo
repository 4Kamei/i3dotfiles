Render lots of background images of the same scene at different times of day and swtch between them  every half an hour, that would create this living effect of the background. Could either render them in very high resolution or create some proc-gen code to do the same, though that would take tons of work.

Proc-gen script for some parallax mountains, could incorperate lighting, but could also 'scroll' the mountains across screens. That would be really, really, really cool. With squirrels and other cute things in there for fun. Maybe every 5 minute or so?
